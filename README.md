## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Mobile-first workflow.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - programming language.
- [Remix](https://remix.run/) - is a full stack React based web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.

### What I learned

- How to use with [Remix](https://remix.run/) + Typescript template
- How to deal with Hacker News API to get the web app done
- How to use Tailwind CSS 🌬️
- How to build tricky comments section 💬

### Continued development

I still find it tricky to use environment variables when deploying apps on different servises.
I'm going to finish another couple of FE challenges to polish my skills in layout and development.
